- [2025-07-24] Core FastAPI and backend dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, python-dotenv, python-multipart, etc.) installed successfully; backend environment setup progressing.
- [2025-07-24] FastAPI backend server started successfully using Uvicorn; main.py is the entry point and server is running with --reload for development.
- [2025-07-24] Created empty __init__.py in backend directory to ensure package recognition; updated import statements in main.py to use relative imports for app modules (resolving ModuleNotFoundError).
- [2025-07-24] Backend server startup attempt with SQLite and absolute imports: Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "main". Next: debug ASGI app/module loading and verify backend startup from backend directory.
- [2025-07-24] Created test_app.py (minimal FastAPI app) in backend directory to verify ASGI import/module loading and isolate FastAPI/uvicorn startup issues. Next: run and verify test_app.py to confirm environment and Python path are correct.
- [2025-07-24] test_app.py (minimal FastAPI app) ran successfully and returned expected message; confirms Python environment, FastAPI, and Uvicorn setup are correct. Import/module error is isolated to main application structure. Next: debug and resolve ASGI app/module loading issue in main.py.
- [2025-07-24] Attempting to start main app with SQLite triggers Pydantic validation errors: DATABASE_URL scheme not accepted (expects postgres*), and FIRST_SUPERUSER marked as extra input. Next: update config.py/settings to allow SQLite for development and resolve extra fields.
- [2025-07-24] config.py updated to support SQLite for development; DATABASE_URI now accepts SQLite connection string and skips Postgres validation logic if using SQLite. Next: retry backend startup and resolve any remaining validation or import errors.
- [2025-07-24] Verified database.py is set up for SQLite; config.py and database.py should now be compatible for local development. Next: verify backend startup with this configuration.
- [2025-07-24] Updated app/modules/core/database.py to support SQLite and dynamic engine config; all database config is now unified for local development. Next: verify backend startup with this configuration.
- [2025-07-24] Backend startup attempt after unified SQLite config still fails: Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "main". Next: debug ASGI app/module loading issue in main.py and ensure FastAPI app can be loaded by Uvicorn.
- [2025-07-24] All SQLite and database config fixes applied; ASGI/uvicorn still cannot import main.py as FastAPI app. Next: further debug FastAPI app loading (import errors, Python path, module/package structure).
- [2025-07-24] Created and ran test_imports.py and check_paths.py scripts to verify app module/package structure and Python path; all core imports succeed and app module is found, but ASGI app loading error persists. Next: further debug FastAPI app loading (entry point, packaging, import context).
- [2025-07-24] Created and ran simple_main.py (minimal FastAPI app) in backend directory; app runs successfully and confirms environment and Python path are correct. Next: incrementally reintroduce main app features to isolate import/packaging issue.
- [2025-07-24] Created and ran enhanced_main.py (progressive FastAPI app); encountered error: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'DATABASE_URL' (should be 'DATABASE_URI'). Root cause: inconsistent usage of DATABASE_URL vs DATABASE_URI in config and database modules. Next: audit and update all references to use 'DATABASE_URI' consistently across the codebase.
- [2025-07-24] DATABASE_URL/URI audit and fixes applied in config.py and database.py for consistent database configuration.
- [2025-07-24] All database config references updated to use DATABASE_URI consistently (config.py, database.py); ready to verify backend startup with SQLite URL allowed.
- [x] Audit and fix DATABASE_URL/URI references in backend
- [x] Update all references to use DATABASE_URI consistently (config.py, database.py)
- [2025-07-24] Validation errors encountered: Settings class reports extra fields DATABASE_URL and FIRST_SUPERUSER (pydantic v2+ extra_forbidden). Must audit .env, config, and Settings fields for strict match.
- [2025-07-24] .env file updated: removed DATABASE_URL and FIRST_SUPERUSER, added DATABASE_URI, FIRST_SUPERUSER_EMAIL, FIRST_SUPERUSER_FULL_NAME to match Settings class. Ready to verify backend startup after env/config sync.
- [2025-07-24] DATABASE_URI validation error persists: Pydantic Settings still rejects SQLite scheme for DATABASE_URI. Next: further relax or bypass Pydantic validator to allow SQLite URLs for development.
- [x] Update .env file to use DATABASE_URI, FIRST_SUPERUSER_EMAIL, FIRST_SUPERUSER_FULL_NAME (no DATABASE_URL, FIRST_SUPERUSER)
- [x] Resolve DATABASE_URI SQLite validation error in config.py/Settings (allow SQLite for dev)
- [x] Further relax or bypass DATABASE_URI validator in config.py to allow SQLite for dev
- [2025-07-24] Attempted custom validator for DATABASE_URI to allow SQLite and PostgreSQL URLs, but Pydantic v2+ core URL scheme validation still blocks SQLite. Further investigation or workaround required.
- [2025-07-24] Custom field type (AnyDatabaseUrl) implemented in config.py to bypass Pydantic URL validation for DATABASE_URI, allowing both SQLite and PostgreSQL URLs; workaround is now in place. However, backend startup still fails due to Pydantic v2+ core validation (URL scheme) blocking SQLite URLs. Further solution required to fully bypass or disable core URL scheme validation for DATABASE_URI in dev.
- [x] ImportError: cannot import name 'ModelField' from 'pydantic.fields' in config.py blocks backend startup; must update or remove ModelField usage to restore backend functionality.
- [2025-07-24] DATABASE_URI is now a string with custom manual validation in config.py; next step is to verify if this resolves Pydantic core validation for SQLite URLs and allows backend startup in dev mode.
- [x] Further relax or bypass DATABASE_URI validator in config.py to allow SQLite for dev
- [x] Verify backend starts without import/module errors after database config fix; continue troubleshooting if needed
- [x] Resolve ImportError: cannot import name 'ModelField' from 'pydantic.fields' in config.py
