# Progress Report - Paksa Financial System

## Completed Tasks

### API Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Standardized API Response Format**
   - Created a consistent response structure for all API endpoints
   - Implemented success, error, and paginated response formats
   - Added proper status codes and error handling

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented global error handlers for various exception types
   - Added detailed validation error responses
   - Created consistent error format with error codes

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implemented rate limiting middleware to protect API endpoints
   - Added configurable limits based on environment settings
   - Included rate limit headers in responses

4. **API Versioning**
   - Implemented API versioning with URL-based versioning
   - Created versioned API routers
   - Added version dependency for backward compatibility

5. **API Documentation**
   - Enhanced OpenAPI documentation with custom schema
   - Added security schemes and requirements
   - Included versioning information and server configurations
   - Added detailed tag descriptions

### Database Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**
   - Created Alembic migration for adding indexes to key tables
   - Added indexes for common lookup patterns
   - Optimized indexes for soft-deleted records

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Implemented QueryHelper class for building optimized queries
   - Added support for filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Implemented eager loading for relationships
   - Created utilities for counting and paginating results

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Read Replicas**
   - Implement database read replicas for scaling read operations
   - Configure connection pooling for read/write splitting
   - Add failover mechanisms

2. **Core Financial Modules**
   - Begin implementing the core financial modules (GL, AP, AR, Payroll)
   - Focus on completing the General Ledger module first
   - Implement multi-currency support

3. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Replace placeholder views with actual implementations
   - Implement dashboard widgets
   - Build data tables with sorting/filtering

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement RBAC system
   - Add permission checks to all endpoints
   - Implement session management

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress in establishing a solid foundation for the Paksa Financial System. The API infrastructure has been standardized and optimized, with proper error handling, rate limiting, versioning, and documentation. Database optimizations have been implemented to ensure good performance as the system scales.

The next phase will focus on implementing the core financial modules, starting with the General Ledger, and building out the frontend interfaces. We'll also need to implement a robust authentication and authorization system to secure the application.
